# Briefcase Ansible Test - Project Overview

## Current Status

**KISS Refactoring Complete ✅** - The codebase has been successfully simplified following Keep It Simple Stupid principles. Major achievements:
- 28% reduction in codebase size (393 lines removed)
- Core functions simplified by 59-78%
- Dead code and unnecessary abstractions removed
- All functionality preserved and tested

## Project Overview

This is a Python iOS application that demonstrates running Ansible automation within an iOS environment using Briefcase packaging. The app provides a distributed torrent architecture where iOS devices can trigger Digital Ocean droplets for torrent downloading.

## Prerequisites

- Briefcase installed (`pip install briefcase`)
- iOS Simulator running
- ios-interact MCP server configured
- Bundle ID: com.example.briefcase-ansible-test
- Run app: `./test_changes.sh` (automated build script)
- Python 3.9+ with required dependencies

## Core Functionality

### 1. SSH Connection Testing
- Test SSH connections using Ed25519 keys
- Generate new SSH key pairs
- Test connections with generated keys

### 2. Ansible Automation
- Local Ansible ping tests (iOS environment)
- Digital Ocean droplet creation via Ansible playbooks
- Mock system integration for iOS compatibility

### 3. Digital Ocean Integration
- Create rtorrent droplets from pre-built snapshots
- Automated SSH key and API management
- Cost-effective temporary compute resources

## Current Architecture

```
iOS App (Control) → Ansible (Automation) → Digital Ocean (Compute) → Local Storage
```

- **iOS App**: User interface and trigger mechanism
- **Ansible**: Automation engine running within iOS
- **Digital Ocean**: Temporary compute resources for heavy tasks
- **Local Storage**: Final destination for downloaded content

## Key Features

- **iOS Compatibility**: Custom mocks and patches for iOS environment
- **Real SSH/Ansible**: Full SSH and Ansible functionality in iOS
- **Cost Control**: Automated droplet cleanup and monitoring
- **KISS Design**: Simplified codebase following best practices

## Next Development Phase

The primary focus is now on **Digital Ocean Integration Testing** to validate the distributed torrent architecture.
