# Briefcase Ansible Test - Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level refactoring plan for the briefcase_ansible_test application to improve code quality, reduce complexity, and follow Python best practices.

## Prerequisites

- Briefcase installed (`pip install briefcase`)
- iOS Simulator running
- ios-interact MCP server configured
- Bundle ID: com.example.briefcase-ansible-test
- Run app: `briefcase run iOS --no-start-simulator`
- Python 3.9+ with required dependencies

## Current State Analysis

Based on the code review, the following issues were identified:

1. **Lazy imports** in `app.py` (violating explicit instructions)
2. **Complex functions** exceeding 150 lines with multiple responsibilities
3. **Code duplication** across SSH, Ansible, and UI operations
4. **Mixed concerns** - UI updates interleaved with business logic
5. **Complex if/elif chains** that could use dispatch patterns
6. **Lack of context managers** for resource management

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Extract pure functions** for data processing ✅ (Completed)
2. **Fix lazy imports** ✅ (Completed)
3. **Simplify complex functions** by extracting smaller, focused functions
4. **Use dataclasses** for configuration objects ✅ (Completed)
5. **Separate concerns** between UI, business logic, and I/O operations
6. **Replace if/elif chains** with dispatch dictionaries
7. **Implement context managers** for resource management

## Approach

The refactoring will be done in small, testable increments:
- Each change will be functionally tested using ios-interact
- Changes will be committed individually after testing
- Existing functionality will be preserved throughout

## Key Patterns to Implement

1. **Reusable SSH utilities** - Consolidate SSH key loading and command execution
2. **Status reporting** - Consistent UI feedback patterns
3. **Resource management** - Context managers for SSH and Ansible resources
4. **Command dispatch** - Replace complex if/elif with dictionary dispatch
5. **Configuration management** - Centralized configuration with validation

## Success Criteria

- All existing functionality continues to work
- Complex functions reduced to <50 lines each
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Reduced code duplication by >50%

## Rollback Strategy

- Each phase should be completed as a separate git commit
- If tests fail after refactoring: `git reset --hard HEAD`
- Keep original functions alongside new ones until verified
- Use feature flags if needed for gradual migration
- Document any breaking changes immediately
