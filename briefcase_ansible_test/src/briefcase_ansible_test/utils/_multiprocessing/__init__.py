"""
iOS-compatible multiprocessing module using threading primitives.

This module provides a drop-in replacement for Python's _multiprocessing module
on platforms where multiprocessing is not available (like iOS). It implements
the multiprocessing API using threading primitives while maintaining API
compatibility for applications like Ansible.

See multiprocessing_ios_analysis.md for detailed architecture and implementation notes.
"""

# This module will contain the threading-based multiprocessing implementation
# for iOS compatibility. The implementation will be added in future commits
# following the design outlined in multiprocessing_ios_analysis.md

__all__ = []

# TODO: Implement threading-based multiprocessing components:
# - ThreadProcess class (multiprocessing.Process replacement)
# - Enhanced queues with exception handling  
# - Context management
# - Synchronization primitives
